        <p align="justify">
          
          This project looked into implementing the De Casteljau Algorithm to interact with Bezier Curves/Surfaces, and some basic triangle mesh editing operations to edge-flip, edge-split, and upsample meshes. The mesh editing algorithms were implemented using the half-edge data structures. From these algorithms, the upsampling method was implemented to smoothen the mesh structures, which could then be used for detailed phong shading.
          <br><br>

          Through the completion of this project, I gained a much better grasp on the concepts of geometric modeling and mesh rendering as they relate to more complex concepts such as phong shading, and mesh modeling. Triangle meshes, and meshes as a whole are fundamental to the graphics pipeline for geometric modeling and rendering. For example, Epic Games, in their unveiling demo for Unreal Engine 5, dedicated a significant portion of time discussing how they were able to compress large triangle mesh structures data for highly detailed real-time rendering with ray-tracing. In this manner, this project allowed me to get a better understanding of this crucial component in the graphics pipeline. For example, I gained a much stronger understanding of proper mesh traversal, mesh manipulation through half edges, and pointer manipulation. I also gained even more respect for graphic engineers, especially those who work with C++, because of the time it took me to implement half-edge pointer manipulation for the simplest mesh manipulation functions.
          <br><br>
          The results of the successful implementation of this project and its various functions can be observed by the final images shown in this webpage.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

        <p align="justify"> A Bezier curve is a parametric curve defined by N distinct control  points. These distinct control points are then used to generate a smooth curve. As discussed in lecture, the de Casteljau Algorithm is a recursive method used to compute this smooth curve by linearly interpolating the N adjacent control points to generate N-1 new control points with a shared parameter t in range [0, 1]. This process is repeated on the newly generated control points until it converges to a single point. This point lies on the Bezier curve, and is the value of the Bezier curve when evaluated at the given parameter t. In this manner, by iterating through all values of t and applying the de Casteljau Algorithm, we are able to generate the complete Bezier curve (see figure below for graphical explaination).

        <p align="justify">
        The actual implementation of this algorithm in the code was completed in the evaluateStep() function whose input is a vector of control points. The function then iterates through the control points and applies the interpolation between adjacent points and stores the output in an intermediate vector list of control points. This vector list ends up being of length points.size() - 1. Effectively, this function completes one step of recursion for the de Casteljau Algorithm. Hence, this function acts as a helper function for later methods that define, render, and manipulate Bezier curves and surfaces.

        <br><br>
        The following sequence of images show the progression of the de Casteljau Algorithm from our implementation on a 6 point Bezier curve, for a fixed shared parameter value, which is then changed in the final image to show the change in Bezier curve evaluation. In these figues, the green curve is the final Bezier curve, the blue points and line segments are the intermediate linear interpolated points (and edges) for a given fixed shared parameter t, and the red square point is the final point generated upon recusive convergence for the same parameter t.

          Task 1 implemented the De Casteljau Algorithm to work with Bezier Curves that are defined in the 2D space. However, as shown in the figure, the algorithm can be extended into the 3D space to compute Bezier surfaces, by computing a Bezier curve along one dimension, and then using the output points to compute a Bezier curve along the other.
          <br><br>
          On a high-level, given NxM matrix of control points, and shared parameters u, v, a point on the corresponding Bezier surface can be computed by first evaluating a point on N Bezier curves each defined by M control points (rows of matrix) with the shared parameter u using the same algorithm as Part 1. Then, the corresponding bezier curve defined by these N output control points is used to evaluate another point with the shared parameter value of v. This output point lies on the Bezier surface. Hence, by traversing along u and v, we can sample all the points on the Bezier surface.
          <br><br>
          To implement this, the <i> evaluate1D() </i> function was used as a helper to compute a point on the Bezier curve for a specific parameter value. This helper function was called iteratively in the evaluate function for each row of the control point matrix with parameter u, to get the N output control points whose values were stored in an intermediate vector list (<i> where N = controlPoints.size()</i>). These N points were then again inputted into the helper function with parameter value v to return a final output point that lies on the Bezier surface.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

        <p align="justify">
          Phong shading is a method that uses area-weighted vertex normals per vertex in place of triangle normals per triangle to interpolate and shade the surface of a mesh. As a result of the increased number of normals, and the fact that they are area-weighted, it tends to look much smoother in comparison to flat shading as shown in the figures below.
          <br><br>
          To compute the normal vector n of a vertex, we iterate through all the adjacent triangles to that vertex using the half-edge data structure for the mesh, and add the normal vectors for those triangle faces in a vector. The triangle normal vectors are computed by taking the cross product of the neighboring edges of the triangle. After the iterations are complete, we then normalize n to get the area-weighted unit normal vector of the given vertex.

          As shown in the diagram above, the half-edge flip function causes the edge splitting the two triangles to flip in orientation and connect to the vertices not previously connected to. In this manner, this function simply reassigns points values for the various elements defined within the half-edge mesh data structure. To implement this function, I employed the recommendations suggested in the spec and defined and set the pointers to the correct elements in the modified mesh for all elements in the modified mesh. This even included any elements that would not end up changing in the modified mesh. Nevertheless, because runtime is essentially O(1) for this function, these additional pointer assignments would not significantly increase runtime. More importantly, it ensured I did not miss any pointer manipulations that would result in a painful debugging process.
          <br><br>
          On a high-level overview, I first obtained the various elements of the half-edge data structure corresponding to the given triangles and inputted edge. After obtaining these references, I proceed with re-assigning the elements defining the half-edge pointers using the <i>setNeighbors</i> function such that the edge is flipped. I then continue with the reassignment process for the rest of the elements (vertices, edges, faces) using these reassigned half-edges. Upon completion, the modified mesh has the corresponding inputted edge successfully flipped.

          Similarly, as shown in the diagram above, the half-edge split function splits two adjacent triangles by an edge connecting the two previously unconnected vertices. In this manner, this function adds 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, 6 new half-edges, and 2 new faces to the mesh. To implement this function, I used the same method of rigorous and at times redundant pointer reference and reassignment for all corresponding elements in the mesh alongside the newly created elements added to the mesh. This helped prevent any painful debugging processes. 
          <br><br>
          On a high-level overview, I first obtained the various elements of the half-edge data structure corresponding to the given triangles and inputted edge. After obtaining these references, I create the new elements and add them to the mesh: 1 new vertex (m), 3 new edges, 6 new half-edges, 2 new faces. I assign the position of vertex m to be the midpoint of the original shared edge (bc in the diagram), and set the isNew value to true. I also set the isNew value to true for the newly created edges that connect to m, and ensure the original shared edge has its isNew value set to false to prevent issues in the loop subdivision algorithm for task 6.
          <br>
          I then proceed with re-assigning the elements defining the half-edge pointers using the <i>setNeighbors</i> function to account for the newly created elements and the split mesh state. I then continue with the reassignment process for the rest of the elements (vertices, edges, faces). Upon completion, the modified mesh successfully splits adjacent triangles along the inputted edge.

          Loop subdivision enables the process of upsampling meshes to increase the surface smoothness of the object. As shown in the teapot mesh figures below, upsampling the teapot mesh significantly smoothens the surface of the teapot where the handle and the knob meet the pot and lid respectively. Upsampling to 256x produces a mesh that is smooth enough that even flat shading renders are approximately equal to the renders done with Phong shading on the original mesh (refer to the figure in Part 3) save for places with signficant shift in normal values (e.g. where the spout meets the main body, only the upsampling method improves the blending between the two components). However, this does come at a significant computation cost (1-5 fps vs 100+fps), indicating how significantly efficient the phong shading technique is in comparison to flat shading at upsampled mesh resolutions.

          Implementation of loop subdivision was done using the recommendations suggested in the project spec and in the comments of the skeleton code. First, we update the weights of all the vertices to be (1 - n * u) of the original weight or position. Where n is the degree of the vertex and u is either 3⁄8n if n > 3 or 3⁄16 if n = 3. Then we take the position values of adjacent vertices and multiplying them by u, and add it to the updated vertex position. Afterwards, we calculate edge position values, by finding the midpoint vertex position for the 4 vertices, v0, v1, v2, v3, corresponding to each edge, where v0, v1 are vertices on the edge, and v2, v3 are vertices on either side of the edge for the corresponding triangle. The weighted midpoint vertex used to assign edge position is calculated to be  3⁄8 (v0 + v1) + 1⁄8 (v2 + v3). Next, all the edges within the mesh are split using the function from task 5, ensuring to flag isNew = true for the created vertices and edges. And finally, to correct the triangulation of the mesh, we iterate through all the edges and flip any edge that connects an old vertex (isNew = true) with a new vertex (isNew = true), then copy the new vertex positions into final vertex positions, and ensure the isNew flag for all vertices is set to false to prepare for the next iteration (if needed).

          Based on how the loop subdivision is implemented we can recognize that the algorithm essentially shifts vertices to maximize localized mesh uniformity. In this manner, sharp edges and other high frequency features that lead to a large variation in the normal value of adjacent vertices are minimized and smoothed over. Hence, sharp edges become more rounded, and this rounding or smoothing process drops off exponentially as the greatest changes to vertex positions for uniform mesh distribution occurs in the initial few upsampling iterations. This can be seen by the significant change in the shape of the cube between upsampling 1x and upsampling 4x in comparison to upsampling 64x and upsampling 256x.

          In addition, loop subdivision can act symmetrically or asymmetrically on a mesh depending on its original topology. For the cube, we observe that the original mesh produces an asymmetric upsampling result since not every vertex has the same degree. Consequently, the upsampling process will reposition vertices asymmetrically, as these reposition values are based on the average of neighboring vertex positions, which depends on the degree of each vertex. In this manner, if we add an additional split to each face of the cube such that each vertex on the cube has a degree of 6, we notice that upsampling produces a symmetric result. The final upsampled mesh still has a cube-like shape but with rounded edges.

            Finally, an interesting observation is that the central areas of the faces of the cube remain relatively flat when upsampling for the symmetric cube topology. If we extend this pattern, we find that pre-splitting edges on a surface with a given topology tends to make the topology more prominent in the upsampled results (i.e. that portion of the surface is not smoothed over as much as the rest of the mesh). As demonstrated in the figure below, the mesh of the face of the cube with extra splits remains much flatter and less smoothed over than the rest of the cube mesh. Hence, pre-splitting edges can increase the persistence of specific features in a mesh which at times can reduce the overall smoothing effect of upsampling.
